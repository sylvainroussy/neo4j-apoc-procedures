# notes on gradle usage for apoc developers

This is a starting point for collecting some doc-worthy parts of the gradle build for apoc.

## specify a neo4j version for your build

Assume APOC is officially building against 3.2.3 and you want to testdrive your build against 3.2.6. You can specify the neo4j version on the commandline:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -Pneo4jVersionOverride=3.2.6 build
----

To grab a snapshot use `-Pneo4jVersionOverride=3.2.7-SNAPSHOT`. Be aware that gradle by default does not check for updated snapshots within 24 hours. See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html#sec:controlling_caching for fine-tuning this.


## Developing apoc against local neo4j build

By default, apoc builds against `https://m2.neo4j.org/content/repositories/snapshots`. To instead prefer local arfifacts when available, add `mavenLocal()` as the first repo in `build.gradle:46`.
